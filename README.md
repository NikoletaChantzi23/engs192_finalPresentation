The code implementation follows the paper's k-means clustering suggested method, in the context of a smart home. 
To clarify, the nature of the data is the same, given that both datasets provide spatial and temporal data.

I have also saved the figures in that same code folder, so that you don't have to spend time running the code (elbow method may take a couple of minutes to run). 
I also tried bisecting K means clustering method for the fun of it, seems like results are similar to k-means.

Let me know if you have any questions/ feedback!
